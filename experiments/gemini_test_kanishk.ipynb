    "**Phase 1: Evaluating best architecture for the given INPUT**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Identify Potential Architectures:** Consider if the described INPUT aligns with or would benefit from known advanced LangGraph architectures such as:\n",
    "    * **Plan and Execute**: Does the INPUT imply an agent which might need a planning step (e.g., breaking down a complex task) followed by the execution of those plans by one or more action nodes?\n",
    "    * **Agent Supervisor / Hierarchical Agent Teams**: Is the INPUT best served by a supervisor agent dispatching tasks to specialized worker agents, or a hierarchy of agents making decisions and delegating?\n",
    "    * **Multi-Agent Collaboration (e.g., Swarm Architecture)**: Does the problem benefit from multiple agents working in parallel or collaboratively, perhaps sharing insights or contributing to a common goal?\n",
    "    * **Reflection / Self-Correction (e.g., Self-Discover frameworks)**: Are there indications of iterative refinement, where results are evaluated and the process is adjusted?\n",
    "    * **Human in the Loop (HITL)**: Does the `description` of any node, or the overall process, imply a need for human review, approval, correction, or explicit input at specific stages (e.g., before executing a critical action, when confidence is low, or for subjective assessments)?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Architectural Decision:**\n",
    "    * If you determine that one or more of these architectures are strongly applicable to the INPUT, choose to implement it.\n",
    "    * If no specific advanced architecture seems directly applicable for the given INPUT, proceed with a standard stateful graph construction based on the explicit langgraph nodes and edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Initial Comment:** At the very beginning of your generated Python script, include a comment block stating:\n",
    "    * Which LangGraph architecture(s) (if any) you've identified and chosen to implement, with a brief justification based on your interpretation of the INPUT, provide dry runs of the usecases/examples.\n",
    "    * If you are proceeding with a standard graph, mention that.\n",

    "    * `id`: The node's identifier.\n",
    "    * `schema_info`: A string describing the structure of the `GraphState` (e.g., \"GraphState:\\n type: TypedDict\\n fields:\\n - name: input\\n type: str...\"). You will need to parse this to define the `GraphState` TypedDict.\n",
    "    * `input_schema`: The expected input schema for the node (typically \"GraphState\").\n",
    "    * `output_schema`: The schema of the output produced by the node (typically \"GraphState\", indicating a partial update).\n",

    "    * `function_name`: The suggested Python function name for this node.\n",

    "    * `target`: The ID of the target node (or \"__END__\" for a graph termination point).\n",
    "    * `routing_conditions`: A natural language description of the condition under which this edge is taken, especially for conditional edges.\n",

    "3.  **Node Implementation (Python Functions):**\n",
    "    For each conceptual node in your chosen architecture (these may map directly to JSON you define):\n",
    "    * Create a Python function. This function must accept the `GraphState` and return a dictionary representing the partial update to the state.\n",
    "    * **Decision Logic for Implementation (Prioritize LLM, No Mock Data):**\n",
    "        * **Default to LLM-Based Solutions:** Your default stance should be to implement an **LLM-based solution** if the node's `description` (from JSON or your architectural design) suggests tasks like:\n",
    "            * Natural Language Understanding (NLU)\n",
    "            * Complex classification or routing\n",
    "            * Content generation or summarization\n",
    "            * Tool selection and usage\n",
    "            * Planning or complex decision-making.\n",
    "            * Any task where an LLM would provide more robust, flexible, or intelligent behavior than simple hardcoded logic.\n",
    "        * **Handling Provided `code`:** If `code` is present in the JSON for a node, treat it as a **low-priority hint or a simplistic example**. Do **not** simply copy it if an LLM approach is more appropriate for the described task.\n",
    "        * **Algorithmic Logic (Use Sparingly):** Only use purely algorithmic Python code (like from the `code` attribute or written new) if the node's task is genuinely simple, deterministic (e.g., basic data formatting, fixed calculation), *and* an LLM would offer no significant benefit for that specific, narrow function.\n",
    "        * **Functional LLM Calls:** When an LLM is used, instantiate a generic model (e.g., `llm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")` or `llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model=\"gemini-pro\")`) and include a **functional, descriptive prompt** relevant to the node's task. Ensure the code for the LLM call is complete and not just a comment. Add a `TODO` comment for the user to specify API keys and potentially refine the model/prompt.\n",
    "        * **No Mock Data:** Generated functions must be logical and aim for completeness. **Avoid using mock data or overly simplistic placeholder logic** where an LLM or a proper algorithmic implementation is expected.\n",
    "        * **Structured Output & Tools:** If the task implies structured output from an LLM or the use of tools, define necessary Pydantic models and/or LangChain tools, and integrate them with the LLM call.\n",
    "            * Define a Pydantic model (e.g., `from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field`) representing the desired structured output.\n",
    "            * If implementing an LLM call, configure it to use the Pydantic model for its output (e.g., with OpenAI's function calling/tool usage features, or by instructing the LLM to generate JSON conforming to the model).\n",
    "        * **Tool Definition and Usage:** If a node's `description` (or your architectural design) implies the LLM within that node needs to interact with external systems, perform specific actions, or fetch data (e.g., \"search customer database,\" \"get weather update\"):\n",
    "                * Define these capabilities as discrete LangChain tools using the `@tool` decorator (e.g., `from langchain_core.tools import tool`).\n",
    "                * **Crucially, each tool's internal Python function should be self-contained and directly perform its advertised action** (e.g., make a specific API call to an external service, run a local script, perform a calculation, retrieve data algorithmically). **Avoid embedding a *new, separate general-purpose LLM call within the tool's own implementation logic* unless the tool's explicit and documented purpose is to be a specialized, self-contained sub-agent (which is an advanced case).** The primary LLM within the graph node is responsible for *deciding to call* the tool and for interpreting its output.\n",
    "                * Bind these well-defined tools to the LLM instance operating within that graph node. The node's LLM will then intelligently decide when to call a tool and with what inputs.\n",
    "        * **Human in the Loop Nodes:** If you've designed a HITL step as a dedicated node, its function might primarily format data for human review and then process the subsequent human input (which would be added to the state, potentially by an external mechanism or a subsequent node). The graph might pause using an interruption mechanism tied to this node.\n",
    "        * **State Coherence:** Ensure variable assignments and updates within node functions are coherent with the `GraphState` definition and how state is managed in LangGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Graph Construction (`StatefulGraph`):**\n",
    "    * Instantiate `StatefulGraph(GraphState)`.\n",
    "    * Add each implemented node function to the graph using `graph.add_node(\"node_id\", node_function)`.\n",
    "    * Set the graph's entry point using `graph.add_edge(START, \"entry_node_id\")` where `\"entry_node_id\"` is the target of the edge originating from `\"__START__\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Edge Implementation:**\n",
    "    * Iterate through the `edges` list in the JSON.\n",
    "    * **Regular Edges:** If `conditional` is `false`:\n",
    "        * If `target` is `__END__`, use `graph.add_edge(source_node_id, END)`.\n",
    "        * Otherwise, use `graph.add_edge(source_node_id, target_node_id)`.\n",
    "    * **Conditional Edges:** If `conditional` is `true`:\n",
    "        * The `source` node of these conditional edges is expected to produce some output in the `GraphState` (e.g., an `intent` field) that determines the next path.\n",
    "        * Create a separate routing function (e.g., `def route_after_source_node(state: GraphState) -> str:`).\n",
    "        * This routing function must inspect the relevant fields in the `state` and return the string ID of the next node to execute, based on the logic described in the `routing_conditions` for each conditional edge originating from that source.\n",
    "        * Use `graph.add_conditional_edges(source_node_id, routing_function, {{ \"target_id_1\": \"target_id_1\", \"target_id_2\": \"target_id_2\", ... \"__END__\": END }})`. The keys in the dictionary are the possible return values from your routing function, and the values are the actual node IDs or `END`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Compilation:**\n",
    "    * Instantiate an `InMemoryCheckpointer`: `checkpointer = InMemoryCheckpointer()`.\n",
    "    * Compile the graph: `final_app = graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)`. The compiled graph must be assigned to a variable named `final_app`.\n",

For this implementation, the LLM within `Content_Suggester` will be prompted to consider trends, simulating this collaboration without explicit inter-agent calls within the graph, keeping the graph structure cleaner for routing.

      "7.  **Graph Flow**:\n",
      "    *   Start at the `llm_node`.\n",
      "    *   After the `llm_node`, use `tools_condition` to decide:\n",
      "        *   If tool calls are present, go to `tool_node`.\n",
      "        *   If no tool calls (final answer), end the graph (`END`).\n",
      "    *   After the `tool_node`, always go back to the `llm_node` so the LLM can process the tool results and formulate a final answer or decide on further actions.\n",

      "**Explanation of the Flow:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **User Input (`HumanMessage`)**: The graph starts with a `HumanMessage` in the `messages` state.\n",
      "2.  **`llm_node`**:\n",
      "    *   The `call_llm` function is executed.\n",
      "    *   It takes the `messages` from the state and invokes the `llm`.\n",
      "    *   The `llm` (which is `bind_tools`'d) decides whether to respond directly or call a tool.\n",
      "    *   The LLM's `AIMessage` (which might contain `tool_calls`) is added to the state.\n",
      "3.  **Conditional Edge (`tools_condition`)**:\n",
      "    *   After `llm_node` completes, `tools_condition` is evaluated.\n",
      "    *   If the `AIMessage` from the LLM contains `tool_calls`:\n",
      "        *   The graph transitions to the `tool_node`.\n",
      "    *   If the `AIMessage` does *not* contain `tool_calls` (meaning it's a direct answer):\n",
      "        *   The graph transitions to `END`.\n",
      "4.  **`tool_node`**:\n",
      "    *   If the graph goes to `tool_node`, the `ToolNode` automatically inspects the last `AIMessage` in the state.\n",
      "    *   It extracts any `tool_calls` and executes the corresponding Python functions (`add`, `multiply`, `get_current_time`).\n",
      "    *   The results of these tool executions are then added to the state as `ToolMessage` objects.\n",
      "5.  **Edge from `tool_node` to `llm_node`**:\n",
      "    *   After `tool_node` finishes, the graph always transitions back to `llm_node`.\n",
      "    *   This is crucial because the LLM needs to see the `ToolMessage` (the results of the tool calls) to formulate a coherent final answer to the user or decide if further tool calls are needed.\n",
      "6.  **Looping**: Steps 2-5 can repeat multiple times if the LLM needs to perform a sequence of tool calls to answer a complex query (e.g., \"add X and Y, then multiply the result by Z\").\n",
      "7.  **`END`**: The graph terminates when the `llm_node` produces an `AIMessage` that does not contain any `tool_calls`, indicating a final answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "This setup provides a robust and flexible way to integrate LLMs with external tools within a structured conversational flow.\n"
