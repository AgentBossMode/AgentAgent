      "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Agent Classes**: Each agent corresponds to a specific task, encapsulated in its own class.\n",
      "   - **DataStorageAgent**: Handles data storage.\n",
      "   - **EmailRetrievalAgent** and **SlackRetrievalAgent**: Retrieve emails and Slack messages, respectively.\n",
      "   - **EmailSummarizationAgent** and **SlackSummarizationAgent**: Summarize retrieved content.\n",
      "   - **CalendarManagementAgent**: Manages calendar updates based on summaries.\n",
      "   - **UserInterfaceAgent**: Handles user interactions.\n",
      "   - **NotificationAgent**: Sends notifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Integration and Workflow Agent**: This is the main orchestrator that runs all other agents sequentially, linking their functionalities according to the directed edges.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Main Function**: The execution starts from the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block, instantiating and running the `IntegrationAndWorkflowAgent`.\n",
      "\n",
      "This boilerplate can be further expanded with actual logic for retrieving, processing, and storing data as needed.\n"
