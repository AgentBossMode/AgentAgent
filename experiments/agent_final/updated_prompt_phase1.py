- Examples: {examples}


Deliverables:
Your evaluation should be presented in the following structured format:

- Architecture Name:
Provide the name of the agent architecture being assessed.
- Concise Identifier:
Suggest a brief, descriptive name for the architecture that encapsulates its purpose.
- Key Highlights (2-3 Lines):
Identify and summarize the most significant aspects or features of the architecture.
- Feature Summary:
Offer a detailed overview of the architecture's unique elements, functionalities, and capabilities.
- Relevance Score (1-10):
Assign a score based on the alignment between the architecture's features and the user's requirements (1 = minimally relevant, 10 = highly relevant).
- Score Justification:
Provide a clear and concise rationale (5-10 sentences) for the relevance score, highlighting how specific features match—or fail to match—the user's objectives, use cases, and examples.
- Implementation Proposal:
Outline a tailored approach for leveraging the architecture to meet the user’s requirements. Be specific and actionable, addressing how it can fulfill the stated objectives and responsibilities.

OUTPUT: Explaination and JSON. Do not include any code blocks. Seperate the JSON and explaination blocks and ensure that there is an explaination for each line of JSON produced but keep the blocks seperated.
Each Output JSON will have a nodes sections containing all the nodes and an edges section

Please follow:
1. Produce the explaination first and then the JSON after it. DO not produce the JSON first. 
2. For any conditional edges, please include all the nodes that the source of a conditional edge can reach as part of the explaination.
3. Any Edge entry in the JSON can only be conditional(mention conditional: true) if the source for that edge acts as a source for multiple edges. If you cannot point to atleast 2 targets for 1 source, then that source will not have any conditional edges
4. A source can have any number of targets. Please write the explaination for each source node to target node edge
5. Please ensure that the JSON starts with __START__ node and __END__ node with the correct edges from and to them
6. Ensure all elements in the nodes sections of the output json contain the following fields: Schema_info, input_schema, output_schema, description, function_name. Please do not return any entries in the nodes without these fields and these fields can't be empty
7. Ensure all elements in the edges sections of the output json contain the following fields: source, target, routing_conditions, conditional. Please do not return any entries in the edges without these fields and they can't be empty

Use cases would be updating customer information, providing customers with the data they ask for, asking customers for their requirements and suggesting them products 3. example 1: input: what is the price of product x? output:  price of x is 300$ example 2: input: Please update my address to "delhi" output: Address updated, here are your new user details-> Name: abc, age 24, Address: Delhi Example 3: I am opening up a bakery and need to setup my supply chain and billing output: We have product x that will output your supply chain monitoring and product Y that would automate your billing and accoutning along with, I would also suggest product z which helps with customer out reach and is generally used by customers opening new business and fits your use case
