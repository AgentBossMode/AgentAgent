    "<Information>\n",
    "\n",
    "<Edges>\n",
    "Edges define how the logic is routed and how the graph decides to stop. This is a big part of how your agents work and how different nodes communicate with each other. There are a few key types of edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal Edges: Go directly from one node to the next.\n",
    "Conditional Edges: Call a function to determine which node(s) to go to next.\n",
    "A node can have MULTIPLE outgoing edges. If a node has multiple out-going edges, all of those destination nodes will be executed in parallel as a part of the next superstep.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<NonConditionalEdges>\n",
    "If you always want to go from node A to node B, you can use the add_edge method directly.\n",

    "```\n",
    "</NonConditionalEdges>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ConditionalEdges>\n",
    "If you want to optionally route to 1 or more edges (or optionally terminate), you can use the add_conditional_edges method. This method accepts the name of a node and a \"routing function\" to call after that node is executed:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "graph.add_conditional_edges(\"node_a\", routing_function)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to nodes, the routing_function accepts the current state of the graph and returns a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the return value routing_function is used as the name of the node (or list of nodes) to send the state to next. All those nodes will be run in parallel as a part of the next superstep.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can optionally provide a dictionary that maps the routing_function's output to the name of the next node.\n",

    "<Command>\n",
    "It can be useful to combine control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). \n",
    "For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. \n",
    "LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a Command object from node functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\n",
    "    return Command(\n",

    "        update={{\"foo\": \"bar\"}},\n",
    "        # control flow\n",
    "        goto=\"my_other_node\"\n",
    "    )\n",
    "``` \n",
    "With Command you can also achieve dynamic control flow behavior (identical to conditional edges):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]:\n",
    "    if state[\"foo\"] == \"bar\":\n",
    "        return Command(update={{\"foo\": \"baz\"}}, goto=\"my_other_node\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Important:\n",
    "When returning Command in your node functions, you must add return type annotations with the list of node names the node is routing to, e.g. Command[Literal[\"my_other_node\"]]. This is necessary for the graph rendering and tells LangGraph that my_node can navigate to my_other_node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigating to a node in a parent graph:\n",
    "If you are using subgraphs, you might want to navigate from a node within a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify graph=Command.PARENT in Command:\n",

    "    return Command(\n",

    "State updates with Command.PARENT\n",
    "When you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that's shared by both parent and subgraph state schemas, you must define a reducer for the key you're updating in the parent graph state. See this example.\n",
