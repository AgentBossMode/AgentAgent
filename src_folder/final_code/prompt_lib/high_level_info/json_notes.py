Some important information:
in the final response add a 'start' node and an 'end' node
Remember to not start conditional routing from the 'start' node, the 'start' node should connect to xyz node from which then conditional routing will happen.                                                 
Check the tools, check if any tool is trying to do more than 1 activity, if yes you should try breaking it into unitary tools.
