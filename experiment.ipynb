      "To design and implement a nutritional LLM agent using LangGraph and LangChain, we will follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Identify the best agent architecture for a nutritional use case.\n",
      "2. Create test cases for the agent.\n",
      "3. Implement the agent in Python using relevant features from LangChain and LangGraph.\n",
      "4. Run the agent to ensure it meets the expected functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Best Agent Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"ReAct\" architecture is suitable for the nutritional agent as it allows the model to:\n",
      "- Actively choose to call specific tools based on user input.\n",
      "- Respond to user queries while reasoning about the outputs of tool calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Test Cases for Nutritional LLM Agent\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some suggested test cases:\n",
      "- **Test Case 1:** User asks for calorie count in a specific food item.\n",
      "- **Test Case 2:** User inquires about the nutritional benefits of a specific dietary choice (e.g., vegetarian, keto).\n",
      "- **Test Case 3:** User requests a diet plan for a specific goal (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain).\n",
      "- **Test Case 4:** User asks about the recommended daily intake of a specific nutrient (e.g., protein, fiber).\n",
      "\n",

    "3. In experimentation, LLM generated good code based on langchain. Used the initialize_agent as well as LLMChain (both deprecated)\n",
    "4. We have only added very few langraph documents in RAG which barely cover enough code for LLM to use.\n",
    "5. There are some steps which are necessary. Subagent 1 could be appropriate design. Subagent 2 could be code implementation. Sub agent 3 could be test case gen etc.\n",

    "1. Web scraping all relevant SK/Langraph/Langchain data, metadata like deprecated should also be taken into consideration and our product needs to present stable and supported libraries. \n",
    "2. Need more work on the python interpreter REPL. We could also look into the DS repl which will allow for modular code execution. \n",
    "3. Code needs to be enforced to create langraph.\n",
    "4. test cases must be tested against a deterministic output, need to read how langsmith allows for unit testing and best ways for graph performance evaluation. \n",
    "5. Some presets need to be established. For instance we cannot allow python code to try initializing any agent other than the one that we actually contain.\n",
    "6. Can we enforce or few-shot prompt code at the code gen step so better results could be obtained\n",
